It should read like a cohesive product demo (think: deploy pipeline / ops dashboard / release assistant), with a narrative flow, sensible UI hierarchy, and a few “wow” moments.\n\n## Why this matters\n\n- Proves feature completeness (tables/panels/layout/live/logging/export/etc.) by exercising *everything together* under realistic constraints.\n- Provides a high-signal artifact for future refactors (human eyeballs notice regressions immediately).\n- Makes the library compelling to adopt: it demonstrates *usefulness*, not just correctness.\n\n## High-level demo flow (expected experience)\n\n1. **Hero screen**: branded title, palette/theme preview, environment capability panel (TTY, color system, width/height).\n2. **Dashboard** (Layout): split-screen UI with header + sidebar + main pane.\n3. **Live run**: progress bars/spinners + streaming logs; deliberate use of markup, emojis, hyperlinks, and named theme styles.\n4. **Deep dives**: Markdown (release notes), Syntax (config/code), JSON (request/response), Pretty/Inspect (structs), Traceback (synthetic error path).\n5. **Export**: optional HTML/SVG export bundle (captures output and writes files) with clear paths + instructions.\n6. **Wrap-up**: summary table/tree + next steps.\n\n## Non-negotiable constraints\n\n- **Must not hang** in non-interactive contexts (CI / piped output).\n- Live/alt-screen/interactive prompts must auto-disable when not a TTY (or via flags).\n- Default run should be reasonably quick (configurable via `--speed` / `--quick`).\n- Must compile and run cleanly with `--features full,tracing` (and degrade gracefully when features are missing).\n- No `unsafe` code anywhere.\n\n## Acceptance criteria (Epic-level)\n\n- `cargo run --bin demo_showcase --features full,tracing` produces a cohesive, impressive end-to-end demo that clearly exercises: markup/styles/themes, tables, panels, rules, trees, columns/align/padding, layout engine, live updates, progress/spinners, logging (+ tracing if enabled), pretty/inspect, traceback, emoji replacement, hyperlinks, and HTML/SVG export.\n- `cargo run --bin demo_showcase` (no features) still runs without crashing; optional scenes display friendly “compile with …” guidance.\n- `cargo run --bin demo_showcase | cat` completes without interactive waits and without runaway ANSI control spam.\n\n## Implementation notes\n\n- Keep the binary self-contained: no network, no external assets required.\n- Prefer a small hand-rolled CLI parser (avoid heavy deps).\n- Treat this as a *product demo*: strong defaults + flags for power users (`--no-live`, `--screen`, `--export-dir`, etc.).\n- Use `Theme` and named styles heavily so the output demonstrates the theming system in a way users can copy.\n","created_at":"2026-01-27T22:34:03Z"}]}

This approach makes integration tests serve three simultaneous purposes:\n\n## The Three Duties\n\n### 1. Integration Tests\n- Exhaustive end-to-end integration tests exercising all public APIs\n- Cover edge cases, error conditions, and typical use patterns\n- Run with `cargo test`\n\n### 2. Conformance Harness\n- Compare behavior against Python Rich (the original implementation)\n- Generate test outputs and compare with Python Rich's outputs\n- Document any intentional behavioral differences\n- Useful for ensuring compatibility when porting features\n\n### 3. Benchmark Harness\n- Same tests used as realistic benchmarks\n- Measure render performance, memory usage\n- Compare against Python Rich performance\n- Track performance regressions over time\n\n## Implementation Ideas\n\n1. Create a `tests/conformance/` directory with tests that:\n   - Generate output from rich_rust\n   - Compare against expected outputs (potentially generated from Python Rich)\n   \n2. Create a `benches/` directory with criterion benchmarks that:\n   - Reuse the same test scenarios\n   - Measure render_to_string performance\n   - Track segment count and allocation overhead\n\n3. Consider a test harness macro that allows the same test case to:\n   - Run as a normal test\n   - Run as a conformance check\n   - Run as a benchmark\n\n## Benefits\n- Maximum test coverage with minimal code duplication\n- Ensures Python Rich compatibility\n- Catches performance regressions automatically\n- Professional-grade testing infrastructure","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"jeff141421@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-19T02:02:26.451406501Z","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone","updated_at":"2026-01-19T02:20:13.323757632Z","closed_at":"2026-01-19T02:20:13.323757632Z","close_reason":"Triple-Duty Test Framework implemented with conformance tests for Text, Rule, and Table renderables","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0}
