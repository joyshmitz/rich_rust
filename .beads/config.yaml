# Beads Configuration File
# This file configures default behavior for all br (beads_rust) commands in this repository.

# All settings can also be set via environment variables (BEADS_* prefix)
# or overridden with command-line flags.
#
# NOTE: Keep `issue_prefix` consistent with the IDs in `.beads/issues.jsonl`.

# no-daemon: false
